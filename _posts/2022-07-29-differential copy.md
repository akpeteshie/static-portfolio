This is a simplified model of a car differential gear system that I modeled in Autodesk Fusion 360 and 3D printed on my Ender 3 Pro. This was an exercise for me to get more comfortable with Fusion 360 and my new printer. I hope to eventually make a mold of the gears to also get some practice injection molding.
