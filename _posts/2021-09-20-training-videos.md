<h1> Texas Inventionworks Student Training </h1>
While working at Texas Inventionworks at UT, I was on the student team committed to developing trainings for the diffferent facilities available in the makerspace. I was mostly behind the camera focused on production and even more on post-production. After filming, I took the footage into Adobe Premiere, and on occasion After Effects, and produced the videos that now exist on the YouTube channel.
