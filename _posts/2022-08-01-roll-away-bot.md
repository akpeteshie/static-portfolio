This is a robot I built that is designed to roll away from you if you try to pick it up. To do this, I have an IR sensor glued into an aluminum can that is connected to an Arduino Nano which also controls two motors driving wheels. When the IR sensor detects al object (a hand) close, the motors are driven to roll the can away from the detected object.
